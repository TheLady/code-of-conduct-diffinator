Codemotion is committed to holding a Conference that reflects the diversity of its community and provides a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of ethnicity, religion, disability, physical appearance or gender. Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect attendees of the Codemotion Conference to be respectful when dealing with other attendees.

Harassment of Codemotion participants will not be tolerated in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to ethnicity, religion, disability, physical appearance or gender, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant or exhibitor engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from a simple
warning the offender to expulsion from the conference. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their t-shirts.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
