Because we value the safety and security of our users and the communities they participate in, Heroku will not sponsor conferences and events that refuse to implement a code of conduct specifically addressing harassment and discrimination. An acceptable code of conduct meets the following criteria:

   * Provide an outline of behavior that is considered unacceptable

   * Provide a system for reporting unacceptable behavior to event staff

   * Make clear the consequences for any behavior deemed unacceptable by the event staff

For an example code of conduct that meets these requirements, we recommend this template as a starting point. If you would like Heroku to sponsor your conference, but do not have a code of conduct in place, please contact the Ada Initiative.

Code of Conduct for Heroku Events

Heroku is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Heroku events.

Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social events.

Heroku's event staff can be reached at: events@heroku.com. Event-specific contact information will be available on signage at Heroku events.
