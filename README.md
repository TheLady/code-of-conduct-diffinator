# code-of-conduct-diffinator

_An archive of programming conferences' & organizations' code of conduct policies. In tasty plain text, with metadata, so they can be diffed painlessly._


### Why
Ability to explore programming conference codes of conduct -- how they derive, adapt, and inspire others -- gives us valuable insights; as programming conference organizers who seek create a code and refine it, as community members who are held accountable for upholding it, and as sponsors who evaluate whether to support it.

Exploring a spectrum of approaches, and their nuances of language, gives us insights into conferences' values, vision, and expectations.


### Contribute
