Django Weekend Cardiff is a community conference.

We value the participation of each member of the Django/Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

All attendees - delegates, speakers, volunteers, sponsors exhibitors and organisers - are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct. If necessary, the organisers will act to enforce it.

Code of Conduct

All attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to others throughout the conference and at all conference events. This includes social and fringe events, whether officially sponsored by Django Weekend Cardiff or not.

All communication should be appropriate for a general audience, which may include children and people from many different backgrounds.

Sexual language and imagery are not welcome.

Django Weekend Cardiff will not tolerate:

  * sexist, racist or other exclusionary language, imagery or behaviour

  * intimidating or threatening language or behaviour

  * insulting or unpleasant language or behaviour

  * harassment of any form

Harassment can include: offensive verbal comments related to sex or gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, body size, race, religion; the use of sexual images; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If there is a problem

If you are troubled by the behaviour of another attendee at the conference, or are concerned that another attendee may be in distress, please speak immediately to any member of conference staff.

Your concern will be heard in confidence, taken seriously, and dealt with according to a documented procedure.

Conference staff - volunteers and organisers - will be on hand throughout the conference. Any concern, whatever it is, will be immediately passed on to a member of the conference committee.

The committee will investigate promptly and if necessary will take appropriate action. This may include:

  * asking a violator of the Code of Conduct to leave the leave the event immediately

  * passing on details of the incident to the Django Software Foundation and Python Software Foundation

  * informing the University or the police about the incident

We will provide you with a written statement of the outcome, whatever it is.

The purpose of the Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct does not exist because we expect to deal with any such problems.

On the contrary, it exists to help give attendees confidence that they are attending an event where high standards of behaviour are the norm, where everyone is aware of those standards, and that something will be done should it fall short.

By signalling inclusivity and diversity as values we expect the conference to uphold, the Code of Conduct helps guarantee that the event will be indeed be inclusive and embrace diversity.
