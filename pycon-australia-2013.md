PyCon Australia is an inclusive event which invites diverse groups of people in ICT -- regardless of age, race, gender, sexuality, or religion -- to discuss and learn about all things Python in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement. We seek your help in making sure that enivironment is maintained at the conference.

PyCon Australia strives to provide a fun, educational and friendly atmosphere within their conferences, and have high expectations for their speakers and attendees so that all can enjoy their experience. PyCon Australia will not tolerate any intimidation, harassment, and/or any abusive, discriminatory behaviour by any speakers or delegates. The use of inappropriate, derogatory, and/or offensive material during presentations and lightning talks is strictly prohibited and will lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal from the presentation and exclusion from future Linux Australia conferences.

All presentation material should be suitable for people aged 12 and above. There are no exceptions to this rule.

If someone hears or sees a speaker or delegate displaying the aforementioned behaviour, they should contact a PyCon Australia Organiser directly. All complaints made to PyCon Australia will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated, and dealt with appropriately.

PyCon Australia Organisers may take any or all of the following measures:

   * The alleged offender may be told to stop/modify their behaviour appropriately and a warning will be issued

   * If the behaviour continues, the alleged offender may be asked to immediately leave the venue and/or will be prohibited from continuing to attend PyCon Australia (without reimbursement)

   * The alleged offender may be warned that enforcement action may be taken if the behaviour continues

   * The incident may be reported to Tasmania Police, or the Australian Federal Police

PyCon Australia is aware of the responsibility required to ensure a successful and productive event. If an incident occurs, PyCon Australia will formally apologise to those offended. A record of the incident will be kept and future measures will be taken to ensure that it does not happen again, including full disclosure to the Linux Australia council.
