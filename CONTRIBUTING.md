# Contributing

Thank you for contributing. Your contribution to the project is truly meaningful. 

Understanding codes of conduct -- how they derive, inspire, and adapt -- is valuable for community participants at all levels. 

Nuances of language reflect the individuality of their communities' unique vision and values.

Ability to make comparisons make it easy for each of us to make consistent decisions that fit our own values and expectations -- whether as a community member, visitor, organizer, or sponsor.
