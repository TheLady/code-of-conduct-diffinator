PASS Code of Conduct

The PASS Summit provides database professionals from a variety of backgrounds with an opportunity to connect, share and learn.  We value the strong sense of community that characterizes this event and we seek to foster an inclusive, professional atmosphere.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, religion or any other protected classification. 

Everyone at the Summit is expected to follow the Code of Conduct. This includes but is not limited to: PASS Staff, Exhibitors, Speakers, Attendees and anyone affiliated with the event. Participants are expected to follow the Code of Conduct at all Summit events, including PASS-sponsored social events.

Participant behavior

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, religion, or any other protected classification.  Intimidation, threats, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome attention will also be considered harassment. Similarly, sexual, racist, derogatory, threatening or other inappropriate language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including sessions. 

Recourse

If a participant engages in any conduct that is prohibited under this Code of Conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling the offender from the conference. No refunds will be granted to attendees expelled from the Summit due to violations of the Code of Conduct.

If you are being harassed, witness harassment, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their “Headquarters/Staff” shirts and are trained to handle the situation appropriately.

A Code of Conduct Committee (CCC) made up of the Executive Manager and three members of the Board of Directors designated by the President will be authorized to take action in response to an incident or behavior that violates the Code of Conduct.

Here is the language of the Code of Conduct Process I have submitted to the Board for consideration:

Code of Conduct Process

All Summit conference staff and members of the PASS Board of Directors are responsible for knowing and upholding the code of conduct. A Code of Conduct Committee (CCC) made up of the Executive Manager and three members of the Board of Directors designated by the President will be authorized to take action in response to an incident or behavior that violates the code of conduct.

Conference participants may report violations of the Code of Conduct to any member of the conference staff. If the reported violation involves physical harm, threats or any other serious offense, the conference staff member should immediately contact a member of CCC. For other reported violations, the staff member should write down a summary to be provided to the CCC as soon as possible. In the event there are any questions or doubts about whether a violation of this Code of Conduct has occurred, the staff member should refer the matter as soon as possible to the CCC.
  
The summary should include,  as much detail as possible, including:
• The name of the person making the report
• The name of the person who was being harassed
• The name of the person that is in violation of the code of conduct
• The circumstances of the incident, including the identity of any witnesses
• Contact information, especially mobile phone number, for the person making the report
 
When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment the staffer should, with the reporters knowledge and consent, record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously; however, the staff member should avoid making any specific promises about what actions the organizers will take.  Similarly, while any investigation will be conducted as discreetly as possible, the staff member should not make any promises that the investigation will remain confidential.

 If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and/or contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.

After being notified of a reported violation the CCC will convene as soon as possible. The CCC will make a reasonable effort to speak to all the principals involved in the alleged incident prior to taking any action. Meetings with the principals should be held separately. The CCC may also choose to speak to others who have information about the reported violation before taking action.

A participant may be expelled by the decision of the CCC for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general, non-exhaustive, examples for when a participant should be expelled: 
• A second  offense resulting in a warning from the CCC 
• Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction 
• A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings 
• A single serious offense (e.g., incidents of a physical nature including punching or groping someone) 
• A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos) 
• Any threats of violence or physical harm

Hotel or venue security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate. Members of the CCC and conference staff should have contact information for each of these entities readily available.

Conference staff should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during, or after the conference.

A member of the CCC will be designated to provide a written summary of any action taken by the CCC to the Board of Directors. This should include a summary of the reason for the CCC’s action and any relevant documentation, such as the original complaint or report. Any action taken by the CCC will be reviewed by the Board. The CCC reports and any subsequent decisions will be archived by the Governance coordinator.
