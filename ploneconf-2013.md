Code of Conduct


Anti-Harassment and Anti-Bullying Code of Conduct.

Plone Conference is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.

This code of conduct will be applied at Plone Conference 2013 to the community members and anyone who chooses to become involved in this event even if the Plone Foundation is not involved with the organization of the event. It is intended to safeguard the public from injury and danger.

Plone Conference 2013 is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any integrators of this event or community members in any form.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, IRC chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Plone Conference. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any Plone event, or expulsion from mailing lists, IRC chats, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from Plone Foundation membership.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from the organizers/representatives of this event put on under the auspices of the Plone Foundation.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
