ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICIES

One of our key goals for RubyConf is to provide an inclusive and welcoming experience for all participants. To that end, we've adopted an anti-harassment policy that we require all attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and staff to comply with, no exceptions. Review our Policies page for more detail.
